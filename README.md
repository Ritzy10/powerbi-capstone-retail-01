## Project Summary
This project analyzes retail sales data across in-store, online, and mobile channels. We cleaned messy data (missing values, typos, negative sales), built a star schema, and created a dashboard with 50+ DAX measures for KPIs, time intelligence, and customer insights.

## Key Deliverables
